# Etherpad ESLint Shareable Config

This package contains an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) [shareable
config](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) that is used
by [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/) and Etherpad plugins in the
https://github.com/ether namespace. You are encouraged to use it for your own
Etherpad plugins so that your code stays consistent with the Etherpad codebase.

## Usage in an Etherpad Plugin

Your plugin is assumed to have the following structure:

* `*.js` files under `static/js` and `static/tests/frontend`, except for any
  `.eslintrc.js` files, are used in the browser.
* All other `*.js` files are used in Node.js.

Install the shareable config:

```shell
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-config-etherpad
```

Use the shareable config in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "eslintConfig": {
    "root": true,
    "extends": "etherpad/plugin"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint ."
  }
}
```

The `scripts` definition is optional. With it you can run `npm run lint` to
check the code.
